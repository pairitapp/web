                You must try to match each word with its translation
                as fast as possible!

        <h1>Team</h1>

        <p class="text_content">
            In a team of two, Rodolphe and Adam, we built the entire app
            with SwiftUI. After months of work, we finally released PairIt
            on the App Store on October 27, 2022.

            <br><br>

            We had the idea to build this app while trying to learn a
            new language. We were looking for an app that would help us
            learn vocabulary rapidly and efficiently. We couldn't find any,
            so we built one!

            <br><br>

            For the sound design and art, all the credits go to
            Elvis a.k.a. CherryLondon, Remi and April.
        </p>

        <h1>How it works</h1>
        <p class="text_content">

            In each game, there are three levels which are in increasing difficulty.
            A level is completed once the user has seen all of the words in that level.
            To show a user new words, we use rounds.

            <br><br>

            Each round contains six words and their translation. The algorithm
            was built in a way such that you can play forever! 
            <br><br>
            First, we built a database of the words and their translation.
            To do so, we collected a list of the most frequent 2000 words in
            English and then translated them into 100+ languages.
            <br><br>
            To decide which words to show the user, we built a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" target="_blank">
                spaced repetition
            </a>
            algorithm based on the time taken to match two words together.
            This means that in any round, some words will be new while others
            have already been seen.
